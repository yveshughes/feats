## Additional Details Based on Your Code

- **State Management for Analysis Results**:

  - In `TryItPage`, after receiving the analysis data from the backend, store it in a state variable, e.g.:

    ```jsx
    const [analysisResults, setAnalysisResults] = useState([]);
    ```

  - Update the rendering logic to display actual results:

    ```jsx
    {isMobile ? (
      <Swiper /* ... */>
        {analysisResults.map((result) => (
          <SwiperSlide key={result.title}>
            <ResultsCard
              title={result.title}
              description={result.description}
              rating={result.rating}
              explanation={result.explanation}
              imageUrl={result.imageUrl}
            />
          </SwiperSlide>
        ))}
      </Swiper>
    ) : (
      <div className="space-y-6">
        {analysisResults.map((result) => (
          <ResultsCard
            key={result.title}
            title={result.title}
            description={result.description}
            rating={result.rating}
            explanation={result.explanation}
            imageUrl={result.imageUrl}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    )}
    ```

- **Handle Image Upload Submission**:

  - Modify `handleImageUpload` to send the image to the backend:

    ```jsx
    const handleImageUpload = async (event) => {
      const file = event.target.files?.[0];
      if (file) {
        // Existing code to read the image
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (e) => {
          setUploadedImage(e.target?.result as string);
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);

        // Send the image to the backend API
        const formData = new FormData();
        formData.append('image', file);

        try {
          const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData,
          });

          if (response.ok) {
            const data = await response.json();
            setAnalysisResults(data.analysisResults);
          } else {
            // Handle errors
          }
        } catch (error) {
          // Handle errors
        }
      }
    };
    ```

- **Update `ResultsCard` Component**:

  - Ensure it can handle dynamic data and displays all necessary information.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the API Route `/api/analyze`**:

   - Receive the image from the frontend.
   - Forward it to the analysis service.
   - Get the FEATS ratings and explanations.
   - Return the data to the frontend.

2. **Set Up and Test the Image Analysis Service on Akash.Network**:

   - Ensure it accepts images and returns correct FEATS ratings.

3. **Integrate LlamaStack API in the Backend**:

   - Generate explanations for the FEATS ratings.
   - Apply safety checks before returning to the frontend.

4. **Complete Frontend Integration**:

   - Display the actual analysis results in the `ResultsCard` components.

5. **Conduct Thorough Testing**:

   - Test each part individually and then the entire flow.

---

## Final Tips

- **Modular Development**: Tackle one component at a time to ensure each works correctly before integrating.

- **Error Handling**: Provide clear feedback to the user at each stage, especially if something goes wrong.

- **Security**: Always validate and sanitize inputs on both client and server sides.

- **Documentation**: Keep your code and project documentation up to date to make the presentation smoother.
