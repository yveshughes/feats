Here are the criteria and their specific prompts: (Include the criteria prompts as before)

Remember: Output ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.

Prominence of Color: Analyze the provided image for its use of color. Rate the dominance of color on a scale of 0 (no color) to 5 (extremely vibrant and varied). Provide an explanation for the rating, mentioning the number of colors used, their intensity, and their prominence in the composition.
Color Fit: Evaluate the color palette in the artwork. Rate the harmony and appropriateness of the colors used on a scale of 0 (discordant or random) to 5 (highly harmonious and appropriate). Include an explanation, detailing why the colors seem harmonious or clashing, with specific examples from the artwork.
Implied Energy: Assess the energy level conveyed in the artwork. Rate it from 0 (no energy or static) to 5 (extremely dynamic and energetic). Provide a justification for your rating, focusing on line movement, stroke pressure, and overall dynamism in the composition.
Space: Measure the extent of space used in the artwork. Rate it on a scale of 0 (less than 10% of the page used) to 5 (entire page fully utilized). Explain the reasoning behind your rating, referencing the portion of the page filled and the arrangement of elements.
Integration: Evaluate the integration of elements in the image. Rate it from 0 (disconnected or fragmented elements) to 5 (fully coherent and seamlessly integrated composition). Provide an explanation, highlighting the relationships between elements and their overall cohesion.
Logic: Analyze the logical arrangement of elements in the artwork. Rate it on a scale of 0 (completely illogical or random) to 5 (entirely logical and consistent). Justify the score by explaining how well the artwork adheres to the task instructions and whether the elements are placed meaningfully.
Realism: Evaluate the realism of the depicted scene. Rate it from 0 (completely abstract) to 5 (highly realistic). Include an explanation for the rating, focusing on proportions, details, and resemblance to real-life objects.
Problem-Solving: Assess the problem-solving approach displayed in the artwork. Rate it on a scale of 0 (no attempt to solve the task) to 5 (clearly thought out and successfully executed). Explain the reasoning, noting how well the drawing addresses the required elements (e.g., a person, apple, and tree).
Developmental Level: Rate the developmental level of the drawing on a scale of 0 (primitive or pre-developmental) to 5 (highly developed and sophisticated). Justify the score, referring to technical skill, proportionality, and attention to detail.
Details of Objects and Environment: Evaluate the level of detail in the artwork. Rate it from 0 (no detail or minimal) to 5 (extremely detailed with complex objects and environments). Provide an explanation for the rating, describing the intricacy and scope of the details observed.
Line Quality: Analyze the line quality in the artwork. Rate it on a scale of 0 (broken, shaky, or unclear) to 5 (smooth, sharp, and intentional). Justify your rating by describing the precision, consistency, and fluidity of the lines.
Person: Evaluate the representation of the person in the artwork. Rate it on a scale of 0 (unrecognizable as a person) to 5 (highly proportional and detailed human figure). Explain the score, focusing on clarity, proportion, and completeness of the human depiction.
Rotation: Identify any rotations or unconventional orientations of elements in the artwork. Rate it from 0 (no rotation or distortion) to 5 (severe or prominent rotation). Include an explanation, noting specific rotated elements and their impact on the composition.
Perseveration: Detect any perseveration in the artwork, defined as repetitive or fixated patterns or elements. Rate it on a scale of 0 (no repetition) to 5 (excessive or dominating repetition). Justify your score by identifying repetitive elements and discussing their significance.
